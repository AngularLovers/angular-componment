/**
 * Configuration for head elements added during the creation of index.html.
 *
 * All href attributes are added the publicPath (if exists) by default.
 * You can explicitly hint to prefix a publicPath by setting a boolean value to a key that has
 * the same name as the attribute you want to operate on, but prefix with =
 *
 * Example:
 * { name: "msapplication-TileImage", content: "/assets/icon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "=content": true },
 * Will prefix the publicPath to content.
 *
 * { rel: "apple-touch-icon", sizes: "57x57", href: "/assets/icon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "=href": false },
 * Will not prefix the publicPath on href (href attributes are added by default
 *
